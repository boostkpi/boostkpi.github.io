**San Francisco, April 10, 2024** — BoostKPI today announced that it has successfully achieved **Google Cloud Ready - Cloud SQL** Designation for Cloud SQL, Google Cloud’s Fully managed relational database service for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.

[Google Cloud Ready - Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/cloud-ready/overview) is a new designation for the solutions of Google Cloud’s technology partners that integrate with Cloud SQL. These partners have closely collaborated with Google Cloud to add support for Cloud SQL MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQL Server into their solutions and tune their existing functionality for optimal outcomes.
